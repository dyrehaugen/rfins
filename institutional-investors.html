<p><em>Braun</em></p>
<p>Rather than
financing entrepreneurs and fostering growth,
pension money has “[inflated] capital markets in
which unproductive takeover and corporate
restructuring activity flourishes, while industrial
production and employment activity stagnate.”</p>
<p>At the same time, their capital feeds an asset
management sector geared toward capitalizing an
ever-increasing share of economic activity, thus
expanding the universe of investable assets.</p>
<p>It is “never noticed” by advocates
of market provision “that financial markets are
not large enough to support welfare transfers.”</p>
<p>Invariably, therefore, the supply of pension sav-
ings in search of investment outstrips demand
for financing from the non-financial sector
(firms, households, government). This mis-
match means that pension capital contributes to
asset price inflation and to declining yields in
established, “conservative” asset classes, which
in turn gives pension funds a strong incentive to
lobby state and federal governments to allow
them to move into high-risk investment strate-
gies and asset classes. In this effort, they will
invariably be supported by the asset manage-
ment sector.</p>
<p>Pension funds’ asset composition has steadily
moved from public, local, and development-
oriented investments to more private, global,
and predatory investments.</p>
<p>In a system in
which financial return is structurally linked to
predation, exercising labor power through capi-
tal stewardship is doomed to fail. Unlocking the
progressive promise of labor’s capital requires
a macro-financial regime that strictly regulates
finance and that allows for greater economic
democracy. The public would play a much
greater role in credit creation and allocation,
labor’s capital would be uncoupled from
the for-profit asset management sector, and
employee equity funds and other forms of
mutual ownership would institutionalize profit-
sharing and co-determination at the firm level. 35
On the transition path to such a “real utopia,”
funded pensions appear as an obstacle rather
than a stepping stone because they create a
sequencing problem—things would have to get
worse for labor’s capital before they get better
for labor.</p>

<p><strong>How Institutional Investors Encourage Corporations Bad Behavior</strong></p>
<p>Wittingly or unwittingly, pensions and endowments’ investment strategies aid and abet activities that make the financial system more fragile.</p>
<p>The growing scale of institutions and the large amounts of money they need to deploy into high-risk investments is leading to consolidation among asset managers, higher global debt levels, short-term corporate behavior, and market instability.</p>
<p>Institutions’ investment strategies are in conflict with environmental, social, and governance goals to which they are increasingly committing.</p>
<p>Pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds and others need to deploy large amounts of capital efficiently because they themselves are so big.</p>
<p>Institutions’ only option in many cases is to put billions of dollars to work in the largest public and private companies, Rothenberg explained. That results in companies, for example, taking on unsustainable amounts of debt.</p>
<p>There are incentives to layer on debt, much of which is supplied by capital markets and the shadow banking sector.</p>
<p>Ironically, institutional investors want to integrate ESG into their process, but they also contribute to corporate consolidation and huge debt burdens. Institutional investors are essentially contributing to some of their own problems in the way they allocate capital to leveraged loans, high-yield loans, collateralized loan obligations
and other higher risk products.</p>
<p>All of this adds to global systemic risks.
Unchecked increases in corporate debt result in increased systematic market risk that boomerangs back to investors and their portfolios
Existing approaches like Modern Portfolio Theory and ESG or impact investing frameworks don’t focus on these potentially negative effects.</p>
<p>Perversely, as major central banks globally respond to the current crisis with rock bottom interest rates and new rounds of quantitative easing (QE), investors and companies are further incentivized to increase their exposure to high-risk debt and inflated asset valuations — a situation that leaves society and markets vulnerable to a rise in interest rates or other unplanned challenges</p>
<p><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1r9js87jhyn8s/How-Institutional-Investors-Encourage-Corporations-Bad-Behavior">Segal - Comment - Instititional Investor</a></p>
<p><em>Rothenburg</em></p>
<p>Many of our existing ESG and impact investing frameworks focus on issues at the
portfolio company level, but they do not take into account potential negative
impacts from capital structures and investors’ influence in shaping them.
Asset allocation strategies can be in conflict with ESG objectives.</p>
<p>The conflict materializes in various interconnected ways, particularly from
institutional investors’ role in increasing global debt levels and
fund manager and corporate consolidation.</p>
<p>For long-term, diversified institutional investors, or “Universal Owners”
of the market, these dynamics eventually translate into lower financial returns.
For workers and communities, these dynamics translate into
greater precarity and inequality.</p>
<p>Potential solutions focus on diversifying asset allocation to
more regenerative investment structures and asset classes, building an
enabling environment through adjustments to team incentive structures, performance reviews,
benchmarking and valuation methodologies, and field-building.</p>
<p>Over the past decades, institutional investors have migrated up
the risk-return spectrum to asset classes with higher yields.
Investor allocations to private equity (PE), venture capital (VC), private debt (PD),
high yield bonds (HYBs), leveraged loans (LLs), and
collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), for instance,
have been growing steadily in response to a number of trends.
<em>While such shifts in asset allocation may suit near-term goals,
such as meeting actuarial targets, this institutional allocation to higher risk asset
classes has also meant increased global debt burdens, corporate and
fund manager consolidation, and risk across capital structures,
resulting in fragility for companies, the real economy, and the stability of
financial markets.
The resulting risks are therefore shared not only by investors,
but also governments,workers, and communities alike.</em></p>
<p>To optimize leverage ratios, companies may prioritize debt servicing or distributions to investors at the
expense of worker payrolls and benefits. Infrastructure and social infrastructure investments — such as
power, water, roads, hospitals, nursing homes, housing, and cybersecurity — might be structured in
such a way that provides access to end-users at unaffordable prices, or of poor quality, in order to meet
investor return expectations and therefore attract capital. Weak capital structures increase the risk of
restructurings or bankruptcies that are detrimental for stakeholders, such as workers. Stakeholders have
increasingly raised concerns about high leverage, coined “financial engineering,” particularly in the PE
asset class, for such reasons. 5 Yet studies produced over the past decades, inspired by PE, praise the
discipline of debt, and due to a number of additional factors, high leverage ratios are no longer confined
to the PE asset class and are prolific across public equity markets, as well.</p>
<p>In practice, the negative impacts of weak capital structures are typically being addressed piecemeal
through company-by-company interventions that focus on corporate operations, like a game of whack-
a-mole; but key roots of the problem — the investment structures themselves — are left unaddressed.</p>
<p>The unintended negative consequences of highly levered investments have been underexplored when it
comes to ESG and impact investing frameworks and practice. Matters relating to investment structures,
capital structures, leverage ratios, earnings calculations, valuation methodologies, benchmarking
approaches, and resulting asset allocation and portfolio construction are not typically within the realm
of ESG-related responsibilities.</p>
<p>Too much leverage is dangerous for all stakeholders.
While leverage looks like a neutral, bilateral accelerant, it
actually reduces financial resiliency at the very times when it might be most needed.</p>
<p>Systemic inequality has been shown to result in economic decline.</p>
<p>Neither Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) nor ESG or impact investing frameworks
currently include a focus on potential negative impacts stemming from
investment structures.</p>
<p>Corporate debt burdens and leverage ratios are historically high, covenants are light, and
defaults and bankruptcies are being held at bay by government support
(e.g. through fiscal and monetary policy) – which is also funded by debt,
though at the sovereign level.</p>
<p>Corporate funding dynamics have changed since the Global Financial Crisis
(GFC), when banks came under heavy regulation that caused them to
restrict lending to smaller clients.
Capital markets, or the Non-bank Financial Intermediary
(“NBFI” or “Shadow Banking”) sector, has stepped in to fill this void.</p>
<p>The financial assets of the NBFI sector amounted to $200.2 trillion in 2019,
accounting for nearly half of the global financial system in 2019, up from 42%
in 2008</p>
<p><em>How Did We Get Here?</em></p>
<p>For the past two decades, institutional asset owners have significantly shifted their overall asset
allocation strategy. Private markets – including PE, PD, VC, infrastructure, and real estate - as well as LLs,
CLOs, and HYBs, have become much larger percentages of overall portfolios. There are a number of
reasons for these changes, including, but not limited to, ongoing declines in interest rates by major
global central banks, dynamics related to funding ratios of institutional investors such as pension funds,
growing interest in the illiquidity premium of private markets, benchmarking practices, investor
dissatisfaction with public markets, and increased opportunity for NBFIs to provide financing following
banking regulations resulting from the GFC. 16 Private capital assets under management (AUM) in 2019
was approximately US$6.5 trillion, an increase of over US$4 trillion over the past ten years.</p>
<p><em>Private Equity (PE)</em></p>
<p>Investor demand is now so high for PE that many are concerned that the asset class is becoming crowded with capital.</p>
<p>Consolidated capital flows stems from the institutionalization of capital.
Markets have evolved from being dominated by individual investors to
having a large presence of institutional investors.
Institutional investors now hold over 40 percent of
global market capitalization of listed companies.</p>
<p>Institutional investors have sizable portfolios and must invest billions
if not trillions of dollars.
With such large chunks of capital to put to work,
they often find it challenging to invest in smaller fund managers,
smaller companies, and niche investment strategies due to a number of factors,
such as transaction costs.</p>
<p>Even when small deals perform well, which data suggests that they often do,
they are hard to justify because they do not meaningfully move the needle
in terms of overall portfolio returns.</p>
<p>A well-documented negative impact of consolidated capital flows to larger
fund managers is that
smaller, emerging, and innovative fund managers can be starved of capital.</p>
<p><em>Institutionalization of Capital</em></p>
<p>The consolidation of capital among institutional investors is a double-edged sword. On the one hand,
institutions offer individual investors professional money management with multi-disciplinary staff and
robust internal infrastructure capable of constructing well-diversified portfolios. Size and scale can also allow
large allocators to influence corporate governance of portfolio companies, as well as negotiate more
attractive terms with fund managers. It is arguable that fees overall are reduced through these dynamics, and
strong ESG practices can be better advocated for. On the other hand, since large institutions need to put
significant amounts of capital to work, they often allocate to the largest managers and companies, thereby
resulting in consolidation of power, profit, influence, and opportunity among a shrinking pool of asset
managers and companies. 53 In order for large institutional investors to act as responsible Universal Owners
and effectively manage systematic risk, it will be critical for them to evaluate their asset allocation practices
for unintended negative consequences that not only impact the real economy, but also markets and their
long-term portfolios.</p>
<p><img src="fig/corporate_debt_ebitda.png" /></p>
<p>This high-risk debt is not limited to private companies. A recent Forbes article highlights how, “some of
the biggest firms in the United States… have binged on low interest debt. Most of them borrowed more
than they needed, often returning it to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. They also
went on acquisition sprees.”</p>
<p>From the corporate perspective, historically cheap credit due to low interest rates is attractive,
particularly when combined with the current tax deductibility of interest expense, studies suggesting
that highly leveraged capital structures do not negatively impact stock prices, and arguments that debt
adds discipline to corporate management. Yet debt and common uses of funds can increase risk for
other stakeholders. M&amp;A has been shown to contribute to corporate consolidation which can stifle
SMEs, innovation, suppliers, the quality and affordability of goods and services, labor’s bargaining
power, and diversification for institutional investors. There is significant literature that explores
negative impacts of share buybacks in public companies, given the links with high executive
compensation and that cash paid to executives and shareholders can deter from reinvestment in the
company, the quality of goods and services, and the workforce. In PE-backed companies, high leverage
from acquisitions and dividend recapitalizations can push companies to cut costs related to quality jobs
and jeopardize the quality and affordability of goods and services.</p>
<p>As central banks around the world doubled down on low interest rates and QE, investors responded by
increasing portfolio allocation to higher risk and yielding asset classes.</p>
<p>The combination of QE and low interest rates with corporate consolidation and high
inequality may well be creating challenges to long-term economic growth,
as well as introducing
potential drivers of instability for aggregate demand.</p>
